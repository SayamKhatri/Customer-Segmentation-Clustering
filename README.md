# Customer-Segmentation-Clustering

# 🏆 K-Means Clustering Project

## 📌 Introduction
This project demonstrates **K-Means Clustering**, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for grouping similar data points into clusters. The **Elbow Method** is applied to determine the optimal number of clusters.

K-Means clustering is widely used in:
- Customer segmentation
- Image compression
- Anomaly detection
- Market research and more!

---

## 🚀 Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

---

## 📂 Dataset
This project uses a **Mall Customer Segmentation Data** from kaggle.

---

## 📥 Installation
Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

1️⃣ **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SayamKhatri/k-means-clustering.git
cd k-means-clustering
```

2️⃣ **Install required dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🏗️ Usage

Run the script to apply K-Means clustering and visualize the results:
```bash
python kmeans_clustering.py
```

---

## 📊 Visualization & Results

### **1️⃣ Elbow Method: Finding Optimal Clusters**
The **Elbow Method** is used to determine the best number of clusters. The plot shows the **Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS)** for different values of **K**.


---

### **2️⃣ K-Means Clustering Results**
After choosing the optimal K, the dataset is clustered, and results are visualized.


---

## 🔥 Future Improvements
✅ Implement **K-Means++** for better centroid initialization.  
✅ Use **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to reduce dimensionality.  
✅ Compare K-Means with **Hierarchical Clustering** and **DBSCAN**.
